\section{Use Case}

A smart grid is an electrical grid which includes a variety of operational and energy measures including smart meters, smart appliances, renewable energy resources, and energy efficient resources.
Electronic power conditioning and control of the production and distribution of electricity are important aspects of the smart grid. Providing reliability in smart grids are done using electronic control, metering, and monitoring. 
To motivate our design decisions we are looking at how a potential user would interact with our system. 
In this chapter we are looking at the Administrators of a small to medium sized smart grid. 
Their main goals are to find failures in near-realtime and to be able to analyze these failures manually. Furthermore they want to have data available for offline analysis to compare overall and individual component performances over time. 


\subsection{User Story}

The system administrators have various tools available for monitoring their system. 
To detect failures heartbeat messages can be implemented, to trace latencies of messages existing tracing systems can be deployed and debugging and logging tools can be used to capture potentially relevant information for manual as well as automatic analysis.
However, a combined and more specialized solution has the potential to provide more value.

\subsubsection{Problems}

The administrators are facing the following main challenges:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Information on node health should be available as fast as possible.
  \item Data for debugging should be available at one location independent of the grid.
  \item Not all Members of the team have a computer science Background. A simplified interface for manual tasks is required.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Value Proposition}

Here is an overview of the features our system provides. Each will be explained in more detail in the following Example section.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Integrated solution: Only the gathering of context information has to be implemented on the pipeline level, then the provenance components will take care of data transfer and storage.
  \item Node Health Monitoring through heartbeat messages and send/receive rates.
  \item Direct queries as well as an simplified interface are available.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example Situations}
TODO
Basically the idea is to repeat what was planned for the live demo
